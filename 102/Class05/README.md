# ***CSS***

***CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** allows you to decorate and design your page to make it look unique.*

## ***Selectors***

***Selectors** are pieces of cade tht allow styles to be conditional based on various features of the elements within the DOM. You have different selectors such as:* 

- *Universal- matches elements of any type.*
- *Type- matches elements by node name.*
- *Class- matches elements based on the contents of their class attribute.*
- *ID- matches elements based on the value of the element id attribute.*
- *Atrribute- matches elements based on the presence or value of a given attribute*

***Combinators** are selectors that establish a relationship between two or more simple selectors, such as "A is a child of B" or "A is adjacent to B", creating a complex selector. You also have different combinators such as:*

- *Adjacent sibling (A+B)- Specifies that the elements selected by both A and B have the same parent and that the element selected by B immediately follows the element selected by A horizontally.*
- *General sibling combinator (A~B)- Specifies that the elements selected by both A and B share the same parent and that the element selected by A comes before—but not necessarily immediately before—the element selected by B.*
- *Child combinator (A>B)- Specifies that the element selected by B is the direct child of the element selected by A.*
- *Descendant combinator (A B)- Specifies that the element selected by B is a descendant of the element selected by A, but is not necessarily a direct child.*
- *Column combinator (A || B)- Experimental
Specifies that the element selected by B is located within the table column specified by A. Elements which span multiple columns are considered to be a member of all of those columns.*
