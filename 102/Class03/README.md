# ***GIT INTRODUCTION***

***Version Control** is a stystem that allows the user to return to various versions of a file or set of files. There are 3 different types of version control:*
- ***Local Version Control**- Entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.*
- ***Centralized Version Control (CVCS)**- Entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients.*
- ***Distributes Version Control (DVCS)**- addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure.*

*Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Git relies on local operations because most of the essential information needed is found within them. Git also keeps tracks of any changes made to any file of directory and makes it very difficult to lose any snapshots of your files. The state of files can be put in 3 different catagories:*
- ***Committed**- Data is securely stored in a local database.*
- ***Modified**- File has been changed but not committed to the database.*
- ***Staged**- Flagged a fileâ€™s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot.*
