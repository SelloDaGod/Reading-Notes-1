# ***JavaScript***

## ***Control Flow***
***Control flow** is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.*

## ***JS Operators***
- ***The Assignment Operator** (=) assigns a value to a variable.*
- ***The Addition Operator** (+) adds numbers.*
- ***Arithmetic Operators** are used to perform arithmetic on numbers.*
- ***The Addition Assignment Operator** (+=) adds a value to a variable.*
- ***The + operator** can also be used to add (concatenate) strings.*
-  ***Comparison operators** are fully described in the JS Comparisons chapter.*
- ***Logical operators** are fully described in the JS Comparisons chapter.*
- ***Type operators** are fully described in the JS Type Conversion chapter.* 
- ***Bitwise operators** are fully described in the JS Bitwise chapter.*

## ***JS Functions***
***A JavaScript function** is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. Defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses (). Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).*

## ***Function Invocation***
*A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it). When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button). When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code.Automatically (self invoked).*

## ***Function Return***
*When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing. If the function was invoked from a statement,JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement. Functions often compute a return value.*
